This is a simple, four-function javascript calculator that only rounds to hundredths. User stories given as guidelines for this project are: 

1. I can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers.
2. I can clear the input field with a clear button.
3. I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output.
